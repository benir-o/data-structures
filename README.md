# Code-explanaion:
**We created a class Node, then proceeded to create a constructor which we instantiated and made it point to the next node. We then created a class "Linked List" and started it off to be empty. We then created a constructor to append the node at the end of the list to contain data. We then created a new node with a loop which checked if the list was empty, at which point it would return the list otherwise, it would move to the end of the list and add a new node. We then added the if __name__ == "__main__":  to indicate that the code block below it should only be executed when the script is run directly & not when it is imported as a module in another python file. We then appended the nodes & printed the list.**
